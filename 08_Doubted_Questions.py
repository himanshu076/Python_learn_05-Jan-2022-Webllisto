    Python Modules Explained
    Python files are called modules and they are identified by the .py file extension. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

    So when the interpreter runs a module, the __name__ variable will be set as  __main__ if the module that is being run is the main program.

    But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the __name__  variable will be set to that module's name.
