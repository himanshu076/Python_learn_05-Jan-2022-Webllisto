'''Difference Between get() & filter()'''

1. The Difference between Django's filter() and get() methods are: get throws an error if there's no object matching the query. filter will return an empty querysetâ€¦

2. Basically use get() when you want to get a single unique object, and filter() when you want to get all objects that match your lookup parameters.

3. get() return perticulate object & filter() return queryset with matched list.
