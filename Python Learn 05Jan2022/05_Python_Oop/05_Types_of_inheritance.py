'''Types of inheritance Python
Difficulty Level : Easy
Last Updated : 25 Sep, 2020
Inheritance is defined as the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from some other class and use it whenever needed. Inheritance provides the following properties: 
 

It represents real-world relationships well. 
It provides reusability of code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it. 
It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A. 
 
Example:'''
# A Python program to demonstrate
# inheritance 
 
# Base class or Parent class
# class child:
#     # constructor
#     def __init__(self, name) -> str:
#         self.name = name

#         # To get name
#     def getName(self):
#         return self.name
    
#     # To check if this person is student
#     def isStudent(self):
#         return False

# # Derived class or Child class
# class Student(child):       #  Derived Class
#     # True is returned
#     def isStudent(self):
#         return True

# # Driver code
# # An Object of Child
# std = child("Ram")
# print(std.getName(), std.isStudent())

# std = Student("Kishor")
# print(std.getName(), std.isStudent())

'''1. Single Inheritance: 
            Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.

Example : 
'''
# single inheritance
# Base class
# class Parent:
#      def func1(self):
#           print("This function is in parent class.")
 
# # Derived class
# class Child(Parent):
#      def func2(self):
#           print("This function is in child class.")
 
# # Driver's code
# object = Child()
# object.func1()
# object.func2()

'''2. Multiple Inheritance: 
                When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritance. In multiple inheritance, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class. 
Example : '''
# Python program to demonstrate multiple inheritance
# Base class1
# class Mother:
#     mothername = ""
#     def mother(self):
#         print(self.mothername)
 
# # Base class2
# class Father:
#     fathername = ""
#     def father(self):
#         print(self.fathername)
 
# # Derived class
# class Son(Mother, Father):
#     def parents(self):
#         print("Father :", self.fathername)
#         print("Mother :", self.mothername)
 
# # Driver's code
# s1 = Son()
# s1.fathername = "RAM"
# s1.mothername = "SITA"
# s1.parents()

'''3. Multilevel Inheritance 
In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class. This is similar to a relationship representing a child and grandfather. 

Example : '''
# Python program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance
# Base class
# class Grandfather:
 
#     def __init__(self, grandfathername):
#         self.grandfathername = grandfathername
 
# # Intermediate class
# class Father(Grandfather):
#     def __init__(self, fathername, grandfathername):
#         self.fathername = fathername
 
#         # invoking constructor of Grandfather class
#         Grandfather.__init__(self, grandfathername)
 
# # Derived class
# class Son(Father):
#     def __init__(self,sonname, fathername, grandfathername):
#         self.sonname = sonname
 
#         # invoking constructor of Father class
#         Father.__init__(self, fathername, grandfathername)
 
#     def print_name(self):
#         print('Grandfather name :', self.grandfathername)
#         print("Father name :", self.fathername)
#         print("Son name :", self.sonname)
 
# #  Driver code
# s1 = Son('Prince', 'Rampal', 'Lal mani')
# print(s1.grandfathername)
# s1.print_name()

'''4. Hierarchical Inheritance: When more than one derived classes are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes.

Example 4:
'''
# Python program to demonstrate
# Hierarchical inheritance
 
 
# Base class
# class Parent:
#       def func1(self):
#           print("This function is in parent class.")
 
# # Derived class1
# class Child1(Parent):
#       def func2(self):
#           print("This function is in child 1.")
 
# # Derivied class2
# class Child2(Parent):
#       def func3(self):
#           print("This function is in child 2.")
  
# # Driver's code
# object1 = Child1()
# object2 = Child2()
# object1.func1()
# object1.func2()
# object2.func1()
# object2.func3()

'''5. Hybrid Inheritance: Inheritance consisting of multiple types of inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.'''
# Python program to demonstrate hybrid inheritance
# class School:
#      def func1(self):
#          print("This function is in school.")
  
# class Student1(School):
#      def func2(self):
#          print("This function is in student 1. ")
  
# class Student2(School):
#      def func3(self):
#          print("This function is in student 2.")
  
# class Student3(Student1, School):
#      def func4(self):
#          print("This function is in student 3.")
  
# # Driver's code
# object = Student3()
# object.func1()
# object.func2()
