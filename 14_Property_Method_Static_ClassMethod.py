Ans. Static Method is Utility, when we need we can call it, it don't have access of class variable or instance, it just can take arguments & return based on that...

1. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
2. A static method canâ€™t access or modify the class state.
3. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.

3. Class Method -- 
Ans. function convert into class method, it have access of clss variable & instance & behving
like class method. it takes cls as first argument...

1. A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
2. They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.
3. It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example, it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.
